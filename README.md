Hey, thanks for checking my portfolio out! Below are my technical documentation projects, Medium articles about Crypto, and a published Psychology article.
# cobogo
This [documentation](https://docs.cobogo.social/) introduces cobogo to users, and I am responsible for mantaining it. Cobogo is a platform made especially for Content Creators, that has the goal of giving them power over their own monetization and their communities, using Web3 to achieve that. It contains two major features, which are the **Creator Profiles**, and the **Split Yield Staking Mechanism**. The documentation includes but is not limited to:
* A description about every [major](https://docs.cobogo.social/overview/how-it-works) and [planned](https://docs.cobogo.social/overview/planned-features) features in the platform.
* Detailed information about the [Tokenomics](https://docs.cobogo.social/tokenomics/cbg-token), including the [token utility](https://docs.cobogo.social/tokenomics/token-utility), [emission](https://docs.cobogo.social/tokenomics/token-emission), [supply and distribution](https://docs.cobogo.social/tokenomics/supply-and-distribution).
* Getting started content for both [Creators](https://docs.cobogo.social/creators/getting-started) and [Fans](https://docs.cobogo.social/fans/referral-program), with quick-start tutorials that teach how to onboard the platform, and get a referral link in just a few clicks.
* A FAQ section about [Blockchain Basics](https://docs.cobogo.social/guides/blockchain-basics) that relate the most to the platform.
* [Weekly Updates](https://docs.cobogo.social/weekly-updates/weeks-1-10) section, updated every week with the project's development.
